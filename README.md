Programming language interpreter implemented with C. 
The entry point is main.c, and the test files are entree1.txt, etc. 

The program works like this:
![Structure of solution](/Structure.png)

The recognition of lexemes is made with an automat while the recognition 
of the syntax is made with a grammer. 
After the syntax analysis an "abstract syntax tree" is created and then 
evaluated.

This is the evaluation of the entree4.txt
![Example of execution](/test_example.png)

The test cases are made in order, starting with basic 
affirmations (entree1.txt). Next level is write/read functions.
Then conditional statements and finishing with loops.
